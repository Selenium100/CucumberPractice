Steps def will be generating cucumber exp by default.
But you can use regular expression also in step def file
You can mix both regular expression and cucumber exp in step defination file.
But you can't mix both expressions in a step defination method.



Regular Expression:
Check Quantifires in java



Cucumber Tags:
Tags I can user Feature level and scenario level also.

I can give in runner class, @tags=@<tagename>

From maven also we can override the tags and give our preferred tag:
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@<tagname>"


Background in Featurefile:
Sometimes there are some repetative steps are there in each Scenarios in feature file. 
These steps are just increase the lines in feature file.
So we can club those steps in a Background keyword.
So before each and every scenario this background steps will execute.
